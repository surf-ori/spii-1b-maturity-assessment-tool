# Open Science Infrastructure Self-Assessment Tool

SPII deliverable 1B, Tool for: Maturity Assessment Tool. Part of the [SPII overview](https://surf-ori.github.io/spii-overview/).
This repository hosts both the tool itself and its feedback/issue tracker.

A self-assessment tool for Open Science infrastructures. Name your
infrastructure, classify the activities it supports, and score it against
one or more assessment frameworks as compliant / making progress / not
compliant with optional notes, then export the result.

Seven frameworks are included today, each as its own JSON file under
[`data/frameworks/`](https://github.com/surf-ori/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/tree/main/data/frameworks/) — edit them directly to tweak
principles, criteria, or copy, no code changes needed:

- **SPII v0.1** (draft, [`spii.json`](https://github.com/surf-ori/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/blob/main/data/frameworks/spii.json)) — 19
  principles across Openness, Autonomy, Sustainability, Interoperability,
  and Researcher-centric.
- **[Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI) v2.0](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)**
  ([`posi.json`](https://github.com/surf-ori/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/blob/main/data/frameworks/posi.json)) — 20 principles across
  Governance, Sustainability, and Insurance.
- **GORC v1.1 Assessment** (draft, [`gorc.json`](https://github.com/surf-ori/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/blob/main/data/frameworks/gorc.json))
  — 55 principles adapting the Research Data Alliance's [Global Open
  Research Commons (GORC) International Model, version
  1.1](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00119) (2024), an aspirational (not
  prescriptive) framework for planning, developing, or operating a research
  commons of any kind. By far the largest framework here, across the
  model's ten essential elements: Governance & Leadership, Rules of
  Participation & Access, Sustainability, Engagement, Human Capacity,
  Interoperability, Standards & Conventions, ICT Infrastructure, Services &
  Tools, and Research Objects.
- **FAIR v1.0** (draft, [`fair.json`](https://github.com/surf-ori/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/blob/main/data/frameworks/fair.json))
  — 15 principles transcribing the [FAIR Guiding
  Principles](https://www.gofair.foundation/fair-principles) (Wilkinson et
  al., 2016) verbatim: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable,
  covering both data and metadata.
- **BD v1.0** (draft, [`bd.json`](https://github.com/surf-ori/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/blob/main/data/frameworks/bd.json))
  — 8 principles adapting the four commitments of the [Barcelona
  Declaration on Open Research Information](https://www.barcelona-declaration.org)
  (2024): making openness the default, working with open-enabling services
  and systems, supporting infrastructure sustainability, and coordinating
  collective action.
- **OSR v0.1** (draft, [`osr.json`](https://github.com/surf-ori/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/blob/main/data/frameworks/osr.json)) — 25
  principles adapting Jeroen Bosman and Jeroen Sondervan's [open science
  resilience model](https://upstream.force11.org/the-resilience-of-open-science-in-times-of-crisis/),
  related to the International Science Council's [*Protecting Science in
  Times of Crisis*](https://doi.org/10.24948/2024.01) (2024). Five areas of
  concern (funding, infrastructure, academic freedom, safety,
  disinformation), each scored across five resilience types (prevention,
  protection, resistance, withstanding, repair).
- **7GPRI v1.0** (draft, [`7gpri.json`](https://github.com/surf-ori/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/blob/main/data/frameworks/7gpri.json))
  — 7 principles adapting the Dutch Taskforce on Responsible Management of
  Research Information and Data's [Seven Guiding Principles for Open
  Research Information](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/files/documenten/Nieuwsberichten/Guiding%20Principles%20on%20Management%20of%20Research%20Information%20and%20Data_11May.pdf)
  (February 2022): trusted and transparent provenance, openness of
  metadata, openness of algorithms, enduring access and availability, open
  standards and interoperability, open collaboration with third parties,
  and academic sovereignty through governance.

## Features

- **Classify** — tag the infrastructure against a research activities
  taxonomy (research life cycle activities plus related activities such as
  managing, documenting, reviewing, publishing, and evaluating), each with
  its own icon.
- **Score** — rate every principle of the selected framework(s), one tab
  per framework, with a live-updating scored/total count in the tab label
  and a status icon (compliant / making progress / not compliant /
  unanswered) next to every principle in the sidebar navigation, so you can
  see progress at a glance without opening each section.
- **Bring your own framework** — import a custom assessment framework
  (JSON) at runtime alongside SPII, POSI, GORC, FAIR, BD, OSR, and 7GPRI,
  download a template to help author one, and export whichever frameworks
  are currently loaded.
- **Export as JSON** — download your results and reload them later to
  continue or revise an assessment.
- **Export as PDF** — download a report of the full assessment.
- **Assessment badge** — download a doughnut-style SVG/PNG badge
  summarizing the score for the active framework, including the classified
  activities as small icons, suitable for hosting on the infrastructure's
  own site.

## Usage

Also live at **[surf-ori.github.io/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool](https://surf-ori.github.io/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/)**
(GitHub Pages, served from this repo's `main` branch — no separate deploy
step). Or serve the directory with any static file server (for example
`python3 -m http.server`) and open `index.html` over http(s); there is
nothing to install or build beyond that. **Opening `index.html` directly
as a `file://` page no longer works** — the seven built-in frameworks are
loaded from [`data/frameworks/`](https://github.com/surf-ori/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/tree/main/data/frameworks/) via `fetch()` at
startup, and browsers block that kind of request from a `file://` page;
you'll see a clear on-page message explaining this instead of a blank
page. The top bar's Import/Export menus cover loading and saving a report
or a custom framework by hand; "About" and "Changelog", also in the top
bar, open as dialogs.

[`data/examples/`](https://github.com/surf-ori/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/tree/main/data/examples/) has three example POSI assessment reports based
on published self-assessments from real infrastructures (OpenAIRE,
OpenAlex, HAL+/CCSD) — linked from the About dialog as one-click loads
against the live site (see below), or load one by hand via "Import
Assessment Report".

### Loading via URL parameters

When served over http(s) (not opened directly as a `file://` page, since
browsers block that kind of cross-file fetch), `index.html` can load a
report and/or a custom framework automatically from query parameters:

- `index.html?report=report5.json` — loads and merges an exported
  assessment report.
- `index.html?framework=custom2.json` — imports a custom assessment
  framework.
- `index.html?framework=custom2.json&report=report5.json` — both at once;
  the framework loads first, so the report's scores for it (if any) apply
  on top rather than being lost.

### Linking directly to a framework

`index.html#gorc` (or any framework id — `spii`, `posi`, `gorc`, `fair`, `bd`, `osr`, `7gpri`, matched
case-insensitively) opens straight to that framework's tab, with its sidebar section expanded
and every other framework's section collapsed. Selecting a framework tab in the app updates the
URL the same way, so the address bar always reflects which framework is open and can be shared
or bookmarked. It combines with `?report=`/`?framework=`: the three example links in the About
dialog are `?report=data/examples/<file>.json#posi`, so they load the report and land straight on the
framework it's scored against instead of the infrastructure-description tab.

## Feedback

This repository is also SPII deliverable 1B's feedback and issue tracker.
Open an issue to propose a correction, flag a gap, or suggest an
addition, using the feedback template (name, organisation, role, and
"representing infrastructure"). See the ["Way of
working"](https://surf-ori.github.io/spii-overview/#way-of-working)
section on the SPII overview for how a curator reviews issues and records
the outcome (accepted, rejected, or already covered) directly on the
issue.

### Saving an assessment report

The Export menu's "Save Report to GitHub Tracker" downloads your report and opens a dialog with
two ways to contribute it, both landing on this same repository:

- **Open a new issue** — attach the downloaded file to a new issue.
- **Propose it as a file (pull request)** — drop the downloaded file onto GitHub's "new file"
  page under [`data/reports/`](https://github.com/surf-ori/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/tree/main/data/reports/). If you don't have write access (the common case), GitHub
  forks the repo for you and opens the pull request automatically — no manual fork needed.

Either way, the report (including any name, description, or notes you've entered) becomes
**public** once you submit it — the dialog says so before you pick an option. A curator reviews
submissions the same way as other feedback before they're merged in; see
[`data/reports/README.md`](https://github.com/surf-ori/spii-1b-maturity-assessment-tool/blob/main/data/reports/README.md) for the filename convention.
